# Minivilles

This is a student project made during our first year at the ENJMIN in 2021.

As a final exam for the C# course, we had to recreate the boardgame "Minivilles" as a console application.
We had to work in group and use tools like GitHub.

The rules of the game are simple.
The players start with 3 coins, and 2 cards : a bakery and a wheat field.

every turn goes like this : 

1/ You roll the die
2/ You apply the cards effects according to the rolled number
3/ You can decide to buy a card to add to your town.
4/ It's then your opponent's turn.

The first to reach 20 coins is the winner !

How to win coins you may ask ? Don't worry, it's your choice ! 
You see the cards can be three different colors : Blue, Green, Red. 
The colour defines when the card activates : 

-Blue will activate on every turn, 
-Red only on the opponent's turn, 
-Green only on your own turn.

Use the arrows to navigate through the different menus, press enter to validate your choice,
have fun and NEVER MAXIMIZE THE WINDOW
